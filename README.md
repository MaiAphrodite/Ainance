## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK 24 (API level 24) or higher
- Java 8 or higher

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaiAphrodite/Ainance.git
   ```

### Configuration
- **AI Service**: Configure your AI endpoint and API key in Settings
- **Currency**: Set your preferred currency symbol
- **Categories**: Customize income and expense categories

## How It Works

### Goal Management
1. **Create Goals**: Set a target amount and date for your financial goals
2. **Make Payments**: Pay towards goals using the "Pay" button - this deducts from your main balance
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor your progress with visual indicators

### AI Advisor
1. **Context Analysis**: The AI considers your income, expenses, and goals
2. **Smart Advice**: Get personalized financial recommendations
3. **Dynamic Responses**: Scrollable, markdown-formatted AI responses

### Balance Management
- **Main Balance** = Total Income - Total Expenses - Goal Payments
- **Goal Progress** = Sum of all payments made to that specific goal
- **Independent Tracking**: Goals don't automatically affect main balance until payments are made
